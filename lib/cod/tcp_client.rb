module Cod
  # Acts as a channel that connects to a tcp listening socket on the other
  # end. 
  #
  # Connection negotiation has three phases, as follows: 
  # 1) Connection is establishing. Sent messages are buffered and really sent
  #    down the wire once the connection stands. Reading from the channel
  #    will block the client forever.
  #
  # 2) Connection is established: Sending and receiving are immediate and 
  #    no buffering is done. 
  #
  # 3) Connection is down because of an interruption or exception. Sending and
  #    receiving messages no longer works, instead a ConnectionLost error is
  #    raised. 
  #
  class TcpClient < Channel
    # Constructs a tcp client channel. destination may either be a socket, 
    # in which case phase 1) of connection negotiation is skipped, or a string
    # that contains an 'address:port' part.
