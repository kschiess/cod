module Cod       
  # A tcp server channel. Messages are read from any of the connected sockets
  # in a round robin fashion. 
  #
  # == Synopsis
  #   server = Cod.tcp_server('localhost:12345') 
  #   server.get  # 'a message'
  #   msg, chan = server.get_ext
  #
  # There is no implementation of #put that would broadcast back to all
  # connected sockets, this is up to you to implement. Instead, you can use
  # one of two ways to obtain a channel for talking back to a specific client:
  # 
  #   msg, chan = server.get_ext 
  # 
  # chan is a two way connected channel to the specific client that has opened 
  # its communication with msg. 
  #
  #   # on the client: 
  #   client.put [client, :msg]
  #   # on the server
  #   chan, msg = server.get
  #
  # This means that you can transmit the client channel through the connection 
  # as part of the message you send. 
  #

    # Receives one object from the channel. This will receive one message from
    # one of the connected clients in a round-robin fashion. 
    #
    # @example
    #   channel.get # => object
    #
    # @param opts [Hash] 
    # @return [Object] message sent by one of the clients

    # <message,channel> where channel is a tcp channel that links back to the
    # client that sent message.
    #
    # Using this method, the server can communicate back to its clients
    # individually instead of collectively. 
    #
    # @example Answering to the client that sent a specific message
    #   msg, chan = server.get_ext
    #   chan.put :answer
